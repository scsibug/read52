<h1 class="alt">Set Your Goal</h1>
<p class="elab">Reading a book every week is easier than it may sound.  Read a couple chapters in the morning or before bed during the week, then finish it off on the weekend.  Or, start more modest with a goal of a book every month.</p>

<h1 class="alt">Track Your Progress</h1>
<p class="elab">Every time you finish a book, enter the ISBN (the number printed next to the barcode) on this site.  We'll take care of finding the name, author, cover illustration, and other information.</p>

<h1 class="alt">Share Your Success</h1>
<p class="elab">Let your friends, family, coworkers, or classmates know about your goal, and show them your page with all the books you've read!</p>
